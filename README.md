# Flappybird
 Here, I will simulate the process of creating the famous Flappy Bird game using Python. This game is relatively simple, consisting of just over a hundred lines of code, making it suitable for beginners.

# Here is an outline of the steps involved:

1. Import the necessary modules, initialize Pygame, set up the game window and define the game's dimensions and load the game assets.
2. Create the game loop: Every command will be in this while loop.
3. Use random library to create random tube and make them move uniformly to the left with a predefined velocity.
4. Draw tube in reverse with a fixed distance to the corresponding one. 
5. Draw a bird, make it move uniformly fast by change its velocity with an fixed acceleration.
6. Check collision by function colliderect
7. Add scoring and game over logic.
