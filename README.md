# flappybird
 Here, I will simulate the process of creating the famous Flappy Bird game using Python. This game is relatively simple, consisting of just over a hundred lines of code, making it suitable for beginners.
 
 Here is an outline of the steps involved:

1. Import the necessary modules and initialize Pygame.
2. Set up the game window and define the game's dimensions.
3. Load the game assets, such as images and sounds.
4. Create the game loop.
5. Handle user input and update the game state.
6. Draw the game objects onto the screen.
7. Add collision detection.
8. Add scoring and game over logic.
9. Quit the game when the player chooses to exit.
